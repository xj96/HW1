Project Title: Homework 1

Description/Motivation: 

    While working on the assignment, I approached it as though I were debugging a file with errors. Instead of removing errors, I was taking out the unnecessary div tags and replacing them with the correct semantic tags. I added alt attributes to the img tags that did not have them. I fixed the heading order in the code and added a title for the webpage. At first the assignment seemed to be hard, but when I got into the groove of knowing what goes where, the assignment wasn't as daunting anymore.
